## üîß Implementation Requirements

### 1. **Prompt Generation System**
```javascript
function generateCinematicPrompt(category, topic, keyElements) {
  const template = getCategoryTemplate(category);
  const environment = getEnvironmentForCategory(category);
  const visualElements = getVisualElementsForTopic(topic);
  const colorScheme = getColorSchemeForCategory(category);
  
  return `Cinematic dolly shot moving forward across a modern ${environment}. 
    Close-up of ${visualElements.device} displaying ${visualElements.interface} 
    with ${visualElements.specificData} in ${colorScheme}. Professional environment 
    with ${environment.lighting}, ${environment.props}. Camera slowly pushes in 
    toward ${visualElements.focalPoint} showing ${visualElements.dataViz}. 
    4k, photorealistic, shallow depth of field, highest quality, ${colorScheme} color grading.`;
}
```

### 2. **Audio Script Generation**
```javascript
function generateAudioScript(topic, benefits, duration = 6) {
  const benefit1 = benefits[0];
  const benefit2 = benefits[1];
  const benefit3 = benefits[2];
  const callToAction = generateCallToAction(topic);
  
  return `${topic} offers ${benefit1}, ${benefit2}, and ${benefit3}. ${callToAction}`;
}
```

### 3. **Content-Visual Alignment**
```javascript
function ensureContentAlignment(audioScript, videoPrompt) {
  const audioKeywords = extractKeywords(audioScript);
  const videoElements = extractVisualElements(videoPrompt);
  
  // Ensure each audio keyword has corresponding visual element
  return validateAlignment(audioKeywords, videoElements);
}
```
