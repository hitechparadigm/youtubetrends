## üéµ Audio Synchronization System

### SSML Timing Implementation

```xml
<speak>
  <prosody rate="medium" pitch="medium">
    <break time="0.5s"/>
    Welcome to today's investment analysis.
    <break time="1.0s"/>
    
    Today we're examining the top 5 REITs for 2025.
    <break time="0.8s"/>
    
    First, let's look at Realty Income, ticker symbol O.
    <break time="1.2s"/>
    
    With a current dividend yield of 4.2 percent,
    <break time="0.6s"/>
    Realty Income has increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years.
    <break time="1.5s"/>
  </prosody>
</speak>
```

### Timing Calculation Algorithm

```python
def calculate_optimal_timing(script: str, video_duration: int) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate optimal timing for audio synchronization
    """
    words = script.split()
    sentences = script.split('.')
    
    # Target speaking rate: 2.5 words per second
    words_per_second = 2.5
    target_words = int(video_duration * words_per_second)
    
    # Adjust script length if needed
    if len(words) > target_words:
        adjusted_script = ' '.join(words[:target_words])
    else:
        adjusted_script = script
    
    # Calculate pause durations
    sentence_count = len(sentences)
    speaking_time = len(words) / words_per_second
    pause_time = video_duration - speaking_time
    pause_per_sentence = pause_time / sentence_count
    
    return {
        'adjusted_script': adjusted_script,
        'pause_duration': max(0.5, pause_per_sentence),
        'total_speaking_time': speaking_time,
        'total_pause_time': pause_time
    }
```

## üìÑ Subtitle Generation System

### SRT Format Implementation

```python
def generate_srt_subtitles(script: str, duration: int) -> str:
    """
    Generate SRT format subtitles with proper timing
    """
    sentences = script.split('.')
    time_per_sentence = duration / len(sentences)
    
    srt_content = ""
    current_time = 0
    
    for i, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
        if sentence.strip():
            start_time = format_srt_time(current_time)
            end_time = format_srt_time(current_time + time_per_sentence)
            
            srt_content += f"{i + 1}\n"
            srt_content += f"{start_time} --> {end_time}\n"
            srt_content += f"{sentence.strip()}.\n\n"
            
            current_time += time_per_sentence
    
    return srt_content

def format_srt_time(seconds: float) -> str:
    """
    Format seconds into SRT time format (HH:MM:SS,mmm)
    """
    hours = int(seconds // 3600)
    minutes = int((seconds % 3600) // 60)
    secs = int(seconds % 60)
    milliseconds = int((seconds % 1) * 1000)
    
    return f"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{secs:02d},{milliseconds:03d}"
```

### Example SRT Output
