# Extended Video Duration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for extending the YouTube Automation Platform to support video generation up to 5 minutes in duration, with corresponding audio scripts that provide comprehensive content coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Extended Video Duration Support

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to generate videos up to 5 minutes long so that I can create more comprehensive and engaging content for my audience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a video THEN the system SHALL support durations from 8 seconds up to 5 minutes (300 seconds)
2. WHEN specifying video duration THEN the system SHALL accept duration parameters in seconds with validation
3. WHEN creating longer videos THEN the system SHALL maintain the same quality and resolution standards
4. WHEN processing extended videos THEN the system SHALL handle increased file sizes and processing times appropriately

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Audio Script Generation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want audio scripts that match the video duration so that the narration covers the entire video content meaningfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating audio for extended videos THEN the script SHALL be proportional to the video duration
2. WHEN creating 5-minute videos THEN the audio script SHALL contain approximately 750-900 words of content
3. WHEN generating scripts THEN the content SHALL be structured with clear sections and natural pacing
4. WHEN creating narration THEN the system SHALL include strategic pauses and emphasis for engagement

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Content Structuring

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want well-structured content that flows logically so that longer videos maintain viewer engagement throughout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating extended content THEN the system SHALL create structured sections (introduction, main points, conclusion)
2. WHEN creating 5-minute videos THEN the content SHALL be divided into 3-5 logical segments
3. WHEN structuring content THEN each segment SHALL have a clear purpose and smooth transitions
4. WHEN generating scripts THEN the system SHALL include engagement hooks and call-to-actions

### Requirement 4: Scalable Processing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the infrastructure to handle longer video processing so that extended videos can be generated reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing extended videos THEN Lambda functions SHALL have sufficient timeout and memory allocation
2. WHEN generating longer content THEN the system SHALL handle increased S3 storage requirements
3. WHEN processing 5-minute videos THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (under 15 minutes)
4. WHEN handling extended processing THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and error handling

### Requirement 5: Cost Management for Extended Videos

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to understand the cost implications of longer videos so that I can make informed decisions about content strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating extended videos THEN the system SHALL calculate and report accurate cost estimates
2. WHEN creating 5-minute videos THEN the cost SHALL remain reasonable and predictable
3. WHEN processing longer content THEN the system SHALL optimize resource usage to minimize costs
4. WHEN generating extended videos THEN cost per minute SHALL be clearly documented and tracked
