# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an automated YouTube content creation solution built on AWS. The system will detect trending topics, generate relevant video content using AI, and automatically upload videos to YouTube with optimized metadata. The solution leverages serverless architecture for scalability and cost-effectiveness, targeting content creators who want to maintain consistent YouTube presence with minimal manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to automatically detect trending topics in my niche, so that I can create timely and relevant content that has higher engagement potential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs its scheduled trend analysis THEN it SHALL collect trending video data from YouTube Data API v3
2. WHEN trend data is collected THEN the system SHALL store it in DynamoDB with timestamps and engagement metrics
3. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL identify patterns within specific content categories (e.g., tourism, technology)
4. IF trending topics are detected THEN the system SHALL rank them by engagement potential and relevance
5. WHEN trend analysis completes THEN the system SHALL trigger the content generation pipeline for high-potential topics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to automatically generate video content from trending topics, so that I can produce consistent content without manual script writing and video creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trending topic is selected THEN the system SHALL generate a video script using AI based on the topic
2. WHEN the script is ready THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock Nova Reel to create a video from the script
3. WHEN video generation starts THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate video parameters (1920x1080, 24fps, 60 seconds duration)
4. IF video generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
5. WHEN video is generated THEN the system SHALL store it in S3 with proper metadata and versioning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to automatically optimize and upload videos to YouTube, so that my content is published consistently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video is generated THEN the system SHALL process it through AWS Elemental MediaConvert for YouTube optimization
2. WHEN video processing completes THEN the system SHALL generate SEO-optimized titles and descriptions based on trending keywords
3. WHEN metadata is ready THEN the system SHALL upload the video to YouTube using OAuth2 authentication
4. WHEN uploading THEN the system SHALL set appropriate privacy settings, categories, and tags
5. IF upload fails THEN the system SHALL retry with different metadata or scheduling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to run on a predictable schedule, so that I can maintain consistent content publishing without manual triggering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL schedule trend analysis to run daily at 8 AM EST
2. WHEN trend analysis completes THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger video generation during off-peak hours (2 AM EST)
3. WHEN videos are ready THEN the system SHALL upload them at optimal times for YouTube algorithm engagement
4. IF any scheduled job fails THEN the system SHALL send notifications via SNS
5. WHEN scheduling conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL queue jobs and process them in priority order

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to monitor the system's performance and costs, so that I can optimize the solution and track ROI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes content THEN it SHALL log all operations to CloudWatch with detailed metrics
2. WHEN videos are uploaded THEN the system SHALL track YouTube performance metrics (views, engagement, revenue)
3. WHEN costs are incurred THEN the system SHALL monitor and alert when approaching budget thresholds
4. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs and suggested remediation steps
5. WHEN performance data is available THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing trend accuracy, video performance, and cost efficiency

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and recover automatically, so that my content pipeline remains reliable without constant monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic
2. WHEN video generation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative approaches or fallback content
3. WHEN YouTube upload fails THEN the system SHALL queue the video for retry with different metadata
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications while continuing with other tasks
5. WHEN system components fail THEN the system SHALL isolate failures and continue processing other content

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to be cost-effective and scalable, so that I can grow my content production without exponential cost increases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is idle THEN it SHALL incur minimal costs through serverless architecture
2. WHEN processing volume increases THEN the system SHALL scale automatically without manual intervention
3. WHEN storage costs accumulate THEN the system SHALL implement lifecycle policies to archive old content
4. IF usage patterns change THEN the system SHALL optimize resource allocation automatically
5. WHEN budget limits are approached THEN the system SHALL throttle non-essential operations to stay within budget
