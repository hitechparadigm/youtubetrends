# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an automated YouTube content creation solution built on AWS. The system will detect trending topics, generate relevant video content using AI, and automatically upload videos to YouTube with optimized metadata. The solution leverages serverless architecture for scalability and cost-effectiveness, targeting content creators who want to maintain consistent YouTube presence with minimal manual intervention.
