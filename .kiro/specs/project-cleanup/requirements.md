# Project Cleanup and Reconciliation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for cleaning up and reconciling the YouTube Automation Platform project repository. The project has accumulated technical debt, duplicate files, and organizational issues that need to be addressed to maintain a clean, efficient, and maintainable codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Unnecessary Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unnecessary files from the repository so that the codebase is clean and focused on essential components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining deployment artifacts THEN all ZIP files in lambda directories SHALL be removed except for the most recent working version
2. WHEN reviewing test files THEN temporary JSON test files in the root directory SHALL be removed or moved to appropriate test directories
3. WHEN checking build artifacts THEN compiled JavaScript files that have corresponding TypeScript sources SHALL be removed
4. WHEN analyzing duplicate files THEN redundant Lambda functions with similar purposes SHALL be consolidated or removed

### Requirement 2: Consolidate Lambda Functions

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to consolidate duplicate Lambda functions so that the system has a clear, non-redundant architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing Lambda functions THEN functions with overlapping purposes SHALL be merged into single, well-defined functions
2. WHEN examining fallback functions THEN they SHALL be integrated into main functions as fallback logic rather than separate deployments
3. WHEN checking enhanced/optimized variants THEN the best version SHALL be kept and others removed
4. WHEN validating function purposes THEN each Lambda function SHALL have a single, clear responsibility

### Requirement 3: Reconcile Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consolidated and accurate documentation so that I can understand the current project state without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing status documents THEN duplicate status files SHALL be merged into a single authoritative source
2. WHEN examining documentation THEN outdated information SHALL be updated to reflect current system state
3. WHEN checking guides THEN conflicting information between documents SHALL be resolved
4. WHEN validating completeness THEN all major system components SHALL be documented accurately

### Requirement 4: Standardize File Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent file organization structure so that I can easily locate and maintain code components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing source code THEN all TypeScript files SHALL be the source of truth with JavaScript files as build artifacts only
2. WHEN structuring directories THEN each directory SHALL have a clear, single purpose
3. WHEN managing dependencies THEN package.json files SHALL be consolidated where appropriate
4. WHEN handling configuration THEN environment-specific configs SHALL be clearly separated from code

### Requirement 5: Update Build and Deployment Processes

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want updated build and deployment processes so that the system can be reliably built and deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the project THEN all TypeScript files SHALL compile successfully without errors
2. WHEN running tests THEN all test files SHALL be in appropriate test directories and execute successfully
3. WHEN deploying functions THEN only the required files SHALL be included in deployment packages
4. WHEN validating deployment THEN all Lambda functions SHALL use the latest Node.js 20 runtime

### Requirement 6: Maintain Working Functionality

**User Story:** As a system user, I want all existing functionality to continue working after cleanup so that no features are lost during reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning up files THEN all working Lambda functions SHALL continue to operate correctly
2. WHEN consolidating functions THEN existing API contracts SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN updating documentation THEN accurate deployment and usage instructions SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN reorganizing code THEN all environment variables and configurations SHALL remain functional
