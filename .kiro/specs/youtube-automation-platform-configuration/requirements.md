# YouTube Automation Platform Configuration Management Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive configuration management system for the YouTube Automation Platform. The system will make all components configurable (AI models, prompts, environments, secrets, costs, features) while maintaining zero hardcoded values, enabling runtime updates, A/B testing, and future-proofing for new AI services and models.

## Requirements

2. ✅ WHEN configuration is requested THEN the system SHALL cache results with configurable TTL and automatic invalidation
3. ✅ WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL notify registered listeners and update dependent components
4. ✅ WHEN validation is required THEN the system SHALL validate configuration against JSON schemas
5. ✅ WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to default values with appropriate logging

### Requirement 2: AI Model Management and Selection ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable AI model selection across all services so that I can optimize for cost, quality, and availability without code deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria ✅ ALL COMPLETED

1. ✅ WHEN selecting AI models THEN the system SHALL support configurable providers for content (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock), video (Nova Reel, Runway, Luma), and audio (Polly Generative/Neural/Standard, ElevenLabs)
2. ✅ WHEN primary models fail THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to configured secondary models
3. ✅ WHEN models are unhealthy THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns and health monitoring
4. ✅ WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL track metrics and enable predictive failover
5. ✅ WHEN new models are available THEN the system SHALL support runtime model configuration updates

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Cost Management and Optimization

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want intelligent cost management across all AI services so that I can optimize spending while maintaining quality and stay within budget constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating costs THEN the system SHALL use configurable rates for all AI services (content, video, audio) with real-time updates
2. WHEN approaching budget limits THEN the system SHALL automatically select cheaper alternatives or downgrade service tiers
3. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL provide cost estimates and enforce per-video, daily, and monthly budget limits
4. WHEN costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL send alerts and implement automatic cost controls
5. WHEN optimizing for cost THEN the system SHALL balance cost vs quality based on configurable optimization strategies

### Requirement 4: Generative AI Voice Integration ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want access to Amazon Polly Generative AI voices so that my videos have the most natural and engaging audio narration available.

#### Acceptance Criteria ✅ ALL COMPLETED

1. ✅ WHEN generating audio THEN the system SHALL support Polly Generative AI engine with configurable voice selection (Ruth, Stephen, Aria)
2. ✅ WHEN Generative AI is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to Neural voices and then Standard voices
3. ✅ WHEN calculating costs THEN the system SHALL accurately track Generative AI pricing ($30/1M characters) vs Neural ($16/1M) vs Standard ($4/1M)
4. ✅ WHEN selecting voices THEN the system SHALL use topic-specific voice mappings (investing→Stephen, tourism→Ruth, education→Aria)
5. ✅ WHEN quality requirements change THEN the system SHALL allow runtime switching between voice engines

### Requirement 5: Prompt Template Management

**User Story:** As a content strategist, I want dynamic prompt template management so that I can optimize content generation prompts through A/B testing and versioning without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading prompts THEN the system SHALL support S3-based template storage with versioning and rollback capabilities
2. WHEN rendering templates THEN the system SHALL support dynamic variable substitution and topic-specific customization
3. WHEN testing prompts THEN the system SHALL enable A/B testing with statistical significance tracking
4. WHEN updating templates THEN the system SHALL validate syntax and maintain template change history
5. WHEN optimizing content THEN the system SHALL track template performance metrics and suggest improvements

### Requirement 6: Feature Flag and A/B Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want comprehensive feature flags and A/B testing so that I can safely roll out new features and optimize system performance through experimentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying features THEN the system SHALL support percentage-based rollouts with configurable user targeting
2. WHEN running experiments THEN the system SHALL collect metrics, track statistical significance, and provide automated analysis
3. WHEN features fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic rollback triggers based on error rates and quality metrics
4. WHEN testing variations THEN the system SHALL support multi-variate testing across all system components
5. WHEN experiments complete THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reports and recommendations for production deployment

### Requirement 7: Environment-Specific Configuration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want environment-specific configurations so that I can maintain different settings for development, staging, and production without configuration conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to environments THEN the system SHALL load environment-specific configurations with proper isolation
2. WHEN switching environments THEN the system SHALL use appropriate AI models, cost limits, and feature flags for each environment
3. WHEN testing in staging THEN the system SHALL use test channels and reduced cost limits while maintaining production-like functionality
4. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL support mock services and fast-mode configurations for rapid iteration
5. WHEN promoting configurations THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and provide safe deployment mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Security and Secret Management

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want secure credential management so that API keys and sensitive data are properly encrypted and rotated without exposing secrets in code or logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing secrets THEN the system SHALL use AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation and encryption
2. WHEN accessing APIs THEN the system SHALL retrieve credentials securely with caching and validation
3. WHEN secrets expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh credentials and handle rotation gracefully
4. WHEN logging operations THEN the system SHALL never expose sensitive data in logs or error messages
5. WHEN auditing access THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed logs of secret access and configuration changes

### Requirement 9: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive performance monitoring so that I can optimize system performance and detect issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL track response times, success rates, and throughput for all AI services
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically implement circuit breakers and failover mechanisms
