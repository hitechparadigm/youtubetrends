## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CDK Bootstrap Required**: Run `npx cdk bootstrap` if you get bootstrap errors
2. **AWS Permissions**: Ensure your AWS credentials have sufficient permissions
3. **Region Mismatch**: Verify AWS_REGION matches your CDK_DEFAULT_REGION
4. **Node Version**: Use Node.js 18+ for compatibility
